Group Members: Rishi Challa, Khem Khadka, Joshua Hernandez, Aryan Anerao, Beau Tate

Main R script file for analysis is located in `Project 2.r`

## Data
All data used for actual analysis is in the `CleanedData/project2CompleteDataset.csv`. Everything else was just used in cleaning. Correlates codebook is located within the `Data/` folder. We also are using stepwise regression in order to choose certain variables to keep and to remove.
